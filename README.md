# rackudn

The rackudn package provides a [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) (a Scheme/Lisp dialect)  wrapper for the NVIDIA [cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) deep learning library.

The approach I've taken is to use the [Torch](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch/blob/master/ffi.lua) Deep Learning library wrapper as a guide.

Suggestions welcome.
